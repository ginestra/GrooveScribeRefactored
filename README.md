- **Modern CSS**: Modular CSS structure with custom properties (no Tailwind CSS)
- **ES6 Modules**: All new code uses modern JavaScript modules
- **Build System**: Vite for development and production builds
- **Improved UI**: Modern design patterns, better spacing, typography, and responsive design
- **Better Maintainability**: Code is organized and easier to understand

## Quick Start

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start development server
npm run dev

# Build for production
npm run build
```

See [QUICK_START.md](QUICK_START.md) for more details.
